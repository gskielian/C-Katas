Know Your gcc
=============

C is fast, but you can make your programs execute even faster if you know how to use your compiler.


For example: 
```C
gcc -O3 myprogram.c 
```

Will perform a high level of execution time optimization and make your programs run really quickly (I use this all the time inside my wavelet algorithms).
